I have run the project with xampp.

It is important to have a smpt service in localhost.

You have to create a table called "hotel" in a mysql database

Connection data:
- url: localhost
- user: root
- password:

To create the structure of the tables, the following command must be executed within the directory:
- php artisan migrate

To use operations in reservations you must access as administrator, the data are:
- admin@example.com
- 12345
